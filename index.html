        <h1>TYPES</h1>
        
        <ul>
            Coffee, a beloved beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans, is cherished worldwide for its rich flavor and stimulating effects due to caffeine. Whether enjoyed black or with milk and sugar, hot or cold, it's a daily ritual for many, offering a boost of energy and a moment of indulgence throughout the day.
        <li><b>Type of bean:</b>There are two primary types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild flavor with hints of sweetness and acidity. Robusta beans have a stronger, more bitter taste and contain higher caffeine content. Both types are widely used in various coffee blends worldwide. </li>
        <li><b>Type of roast:</b>There are two primary types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild flavor with hints of sweetness and acidity. Robusta beans have a stronger, more bitter taste and contain higher caffeine content. Both types are widely used in various coffee blends worldwide.</li>
        <li><b>Type of grind:</b>Coffee grind types vary based on brewing methods. Coarse grinds are ideal for French press, with large particles. Medium grinds suit drip coffee makers, balancing extraction time. Fine grinds are used in espresso machines for quick extraction. Extra-fine grinds, like powder, are essential for Turkish coffee, ensuring maximum flavor extraction.</li>
        <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee:</b>Decaffeinated coffee undergoes a process to remove most of the caffeine from coffee beans while retaining their flavor. Typically, beans are steamed or soaked in water to extract caffeine, often using a solvent like ethyl acetate or CO2. This process allows coffee lovers to enjoy the taste and aroma of coffee without the stimulating effects of caffeine. While decaf still contains a small amount of caffeine (usually 1-2% of the original content), it's significantly lower than regular coffee. It's a popular choice for those sensitive to caffeine or wanting to enjoy coffee later in the day without affecting sleep.</li></ul>
